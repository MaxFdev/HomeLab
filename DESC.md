My home lab is an ongoing project that serves as the backbone for my technological endeavors. In the center of the lab is a PC running Proxmox, providing versatile virtualization platform. Through Proxmox I can manage and deploy various virtual machines and containers for various projects and experiments. I have also established a secure and remote-accessible environment for my home lab by utilizing a single-board computer (SBC) running Ubuntu server and Cloudflared. This allows me to seamlessly access and manage the lab's resources from anywhere with an internet connection.
