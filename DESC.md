My home lab is an ongoing and continuously evolving project that serves as the backbone for my technological endeavors. At the heart of the lab is a custom-built PC running Proxmox, providing a powerful and versatile virtualization platform. This setup enables me to efficiently manage and deploy various virtual machines and containers for various projects and experiments. I have also established a secure and remote-accessible environment for my home lab by utilizing a single-board computer (SBC) running Ubuntu server and Cloudflared. This allows me to seamlessly access and manage the lab's resources from anywhere with an internet connection. The home lab empowers me to explore and test new technologies, optimize workflows, and ensure a reliable infrastructure to support my projects and technical aspirations.
